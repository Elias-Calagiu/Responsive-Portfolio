# Responsive-Portfolio

I was tasked with creating an "About me" responsive portfolio. 

To accomplish this task I first created a ubiquitous navbar (with code taken from bootstrap) with my name on the left and responsive buttons on the right of the page. To move the responsive buttons to the right I went into the navbar code and switched "mr auto" to "ml-auto".

I used bootstrap's grid system and forms to create a responsive contact info page.

I used bootstrap's grid system to create a responsive portfolio page with 5 images.
